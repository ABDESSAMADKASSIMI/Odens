Hey Adam, hey team! Curious about what’s happening under the hood?
Let’s take a little backstage tour of your Oden Platform—where each user gets their own private AI “lab” and everything is automated, secure, and (let’s be honest) kind of magical.

---

### 1️⃣ **Sign Up & Get Your Own Secret Lab 🧪**

When you sign up, Oden Platform doesn’t just jot your name down—it builds a whole digital “lab” just for you!
You get your own encrypted vault, neatly organized with folders for your training data, predictions, models, and more. (No password leaks—everything’s locked up tighter than a Swedish safe. 🔒)

---

### 2️⃣ **Login & Land in Your Zone 🚪**

Punch in your credentials, and you’re right back in your lab.

* All your previous data
* All your models and results
* Everything’s waiting, and *only you* can see it (not even us—promise!).

---

### 3️⃣ **The Dashboard: Your AI Command Center 🎛️**

Zip around the sidebar like a pro:

* 🏠 **Home:** See your welcome message and today’s aluminium prices—live from the market!
* 📈 **Prediction:** Fill in the blanks, hit go, and get instant price predictions.
* 🤖 **IA Model:** Upload your latest PDF quotes and watch the AI retrain itself—no PhD required.
* 📊 **Statistics:** Nerd out on performance graphs and error metrics. Compare different model runs, see where you shine.
* 📁 **Versions:** All your model versions, in one place—promote, roll back, or delete like a true AI boss.

*(And yes, every button is rigged to only work with **your** data. No accidental “sharing” here!)*

### 4️⃣ **Prediction & Continuous Learning: Your AI Gets Smarter While You Sleep 💤**

Every prediction you make? We save it.
Hit 50 new quotes, and—abracadabra—the system retrains your model with the latest info, all on its own.
Old models don’t vanish—they’re safely versioned, just in case you want to revisit the “good old days” of last week’s AI.

---

### 5️⃣ **Model Versioning: Your AI, Your Rules 🏆**

* Every training run is stored with its own results and timestamp.
* Want to try an older model? Switch in one click.
* Tired of a version? Yeet it into the void (delete it, that is).
* Full history is there for your inner detective.

---

### 6️⃣ **Security & Privacy: Fort Knox, but Swedish 🛡️**

No user can ever peek at another’s data—every folder, every file, every prediction is strictly private.
Passwords and sensitive stuff? All encrypted, all the time.
Whether there are 2 or 200 users, nobody steps on anyone else’s toes (or files).

---

### 7️⃣ **A Modern Experience with Real-Time Data 🎨**

* The app feels fast and fresh, thanks to a slick interface (CustomTkinter!).
* Live aluminium prices update right on your dashboard, so you’re always ahead of the market.

**TL;DR:**
Oden Platform gives you your own AI pricing “lab” with zero hassle—secure, private, and getting smarter the more you use it.
The magic? It’s all in the code. And maybe just a bit in the Swedish air. 😉
