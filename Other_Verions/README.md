# ðŸ“š Model Versioning & Training Scripts

Throughout this project, we faced many modeling challenges and tested a variety of solutionsâ€”each time, saving our code for reproducibility and future comparison.

**What did we do?**

* For every significant version (from V1 up to V7), we kept the *full model training script*â€”including all data loading, preprocessing, model definition, and evaluation steps.
* Each script reflects a different modeling strategy:
  Youâ€™ll find approaches with CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, TabNet, PyTorch MLP, feature selection utilities, Optuna hyperparameter optimization, and more.
* We always saved the version that achieved the best results *at the time*, but we didnâ€™t throw away the othersâ€”so the team can review what worked and what didnâ€™t.

**Want to dig deeper?**
If youâ€™re interested in how we processed data for any specific version, or want to see our preprocessing code or feature engineering steps, just askâ€”I'm happy to share any scripts or explain the logic behind any experiment.

**How to use these scripts:**

* Each `Verion_X.py` file is standalone: you can run it to retrain or benchmark that approach.
* They make great references if you want to re-test, reproduce results, or compare new ideas to our previous models.

**If you have any questions or want to explore a particular versionâ€™s data processing workflow in detail, let me knowâ€”I'll gladly walk you through it or provide the necessary code.**
