📝 Architecture / Conception Trace
Hey,

This folder just contains the hand-drawn conception/architecture diagrams (tracés) I made.
It’s here so that—if I need to change or revisit things months or years from now—I can quickly remember the logic and understand the code structure without having to dig through everything again.

That’s all!
If you’re reading this in the future and need to update something, just check these diagrams first—they’ll save you time. 😄
