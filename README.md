Ready to go pro?
You can upload your own data (PDF quotes) and let the platform do all the work:
From data processing to AI model training, it’s all automated.

Every price you predict is saved—and when you’ve predicted 50 new quotes, we retrain your model automatically, so you’re always using the latest data.

It’s like your AI gets smarter while you sleep—
honestly, sometimes we think it’s even smarter than ChatGPT or DeepSeek haha 😴🤖💥
